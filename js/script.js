// Look ma' no JS! :)

/*
I have seen demos of pure CSS Tic-tac-toe games, but I was unable to find a version that truly works. If I have missed it, please send me link, so I can see how another dev has created it.

My version works as any normal Tic-tac-toe game would: 2 players can play against each other, it can result in either a win or a tie. Players can also restart the game.

In my CodePen example, I used Jade and SASS, so that my code looks much cleaner and simpler to understand.
